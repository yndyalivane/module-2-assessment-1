                            <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
    <p>Monkeys are magnificent, mischievous, and sometimes mysterious—monkeys! They have many 
	different adaptations, depending on their habitat. Most are arboreal. Others,
	like macaques, baboons, and some mangabeys, are more terrestrial. All monkeys can use
	their hands and feet for holding on to branches, but some arboreal monkeys can use
	their tails, too. Tails that can grab and hold are called prehensile. These special
	tails are ridged on the underside and very flexible, so much so that they can grab a
	tree branch or pick up something as small as a peanut!</p>
     <p>Monkeys are found in two main regions of the world, so scientists have grouped
	 them as either Old World monkeys or New World monkeys. Old World monkeys are found
	 in Africa and Asia. Some examples are guenons, mangabeys, macaques, baboons, and 
	 colobus monkeys. New World monkeys are found in Mexico, Central America, and South America.
	 Some examples are woolly monkeys, spider monkeys, howler monkeys, capuchin monkeys,
	 and squirrel monkeys. Marmosets and tamarins also live in New World habitats but are
	 different enough to be in their own different scientific grouping. </p>
   <p>Most monkeys live in the tropical rainforests of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America,
   or the savannas of Africa. Geladas and golden monkeys are mountain dwellers, and Japanese macaques
   live in parts of Japan where it snows; these are the monkeys you may have seen on TV that find hot
   springs and spend a lot of time in the winter sitting in the warm water—kind of like a macaque
   Jacuzzi! Baboons live in savannas, open wooded areas, and rocky hillsides; although they are able
   to climb trees, they spend most of their time on the ground.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the monkeys at the monkey trail.</p>
