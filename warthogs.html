                            <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
    <p>The common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the pig family (Suidae) found
	in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa. In the past, it was commonly 
	treated as a subspecies of P. aethiopicus, but today that scientific name is restricted to the
	desert warthog of northern Kenya, Somalia, and eastern Ethiopia.</p>
	<p>The head of the common warthog is large, with a mane down the spine to the middle of the back.
	Sparse hair covers the body. Its color is usually black or brown. Tails are long and end with a tuft of hair.
	Common warthogs do not have subcutaneous fat and the coat is sparse, making them susceptible to extreme
	environmental temperatures.</p>
   <p>The common warthog is the only pig species that has adapted to grazing and savanna habitats.
   Its diet is omnivorous, composed of grasses, roots, berries and other fruits, bark, fungi, insects,
   eggs and carrion. The diet is seasonably variable, depending on availability of different food items.</p>
