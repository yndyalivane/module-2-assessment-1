                            <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
    <p>The giraffe is the world’s tallest land mammal and the Rothschild’s giraffe is one of 
	the tallest subspecies, growing up to 6m tall. Its colouring is unique compared to other
	giraffes as their markings stop half way down their legs. Giraffes live in small herds with
	males and females living separately outside of the breeding season. Females give birth to
	a single calf after a gestation period of around 15 months.The Rothschild’s giraffe, also
	known as the Baringo or Ugandan giraffe is a subspecies of the Northern giraffe. It was
	named after the London zoologist Lionel Water Rothschild who first described the subspecies
	in the early 1900s.</p>
     <p>The lifespan of giraffes is 20 years, the subspecies is classified as endangered.
	 The population is estimated to be less than 2,500 individuals. Numbers have increased 
	 slightly since the 1960s but remain very low. Giraffes are herbivores. They have an
	 impressive 45cm long tongue which, together with their long neck, helps them to reach 
	 and pull down the branches of tall trees. Their diet includes leaves, stems flowers and
	 fruit. Males can eat up to 130kg of leaves in a day.</p>
   <p>The Rothschild’s giraffe inhabits woodlands, savannahs and grasslands. It used to be 
    abundant across Kenya, Uganda and Sudan but is now only found in small populations in
	western Kenya and northern Uganda. Around 60% of the population is found in Uganda.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
