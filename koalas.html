                            <h3>KOALAS</h3>
    <p>The koala is about 60 to 85 cm (24 to 33 inches) long and weighs up to 14 kg 
	(31 pounds) in the southern part of its range (Victoria) but only about half that
	in subtropical Queensland to the north. Virtually tailless, the body is stout and
	gray, with a pale yellow or cream-coloured chest and mottling on the rump.
	The broad face has a wide, rounded, leathery nose, small yellow eyes, and big fluffy ears.
	The feet are strong and clawed; the two inner digits of the front feet and the innermost
	digit of the hind feet are opposable for grasping. Because of the animalâ€™s superficial 
	resemblance to a small bear, the koala is sometimes called, albeit erroneously, the koala bear.</p>
     <p>The koala feeds very selectively on the leaves of certain eucalyptus trees. 
	 Generally solitary, individuals move within a home range of more than a dozen 
	 trees, one of which is favoured over the others. If koalas become too numerous 
	 in a restricted area, they defoliate preferred food trees and, unable to subsist
	 on even closely related species, decline rapidly.</p>
   <p>Koalas live over a range of open forest and woodland communities but ultimately their
   habitat is defined by the presence of a select group of food trees. Koalas are found in
   higher densities where food trees are growing on more fertile soils and along watercourses.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
