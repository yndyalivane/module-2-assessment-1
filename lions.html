                            <h3>LIONS</h3>
    <p>Lions are reffered to as The King of the jungle.It has a muscular, deep-chested body,
	short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic;
	adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.</p>
     <p>The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and
	 appearance vary considerably between the sexes. The male’s outstanding characteristic is
	 his mane, which varies between different individuals and populations. It may be entirely 
	 lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering the back of the head,
	 neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly.
	 In some lions the mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the cat a majestic appearance.
	 Manes make males look larger and may serve to intimidate rivals or impress prospective mates.
	 A full-grown male is about 1.8–2.1 metres (6–7 feet) long, excluding the 1-metre tail; he stands 
	 about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder and weighs 170–230 kg (370–500 pounds). The female, or lioness, 
	 is smaller, with a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of 0.9–1.1 metres, and a weight of 120–180 kg.
	 The lion’s coat is short and varies in colour from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery gray to dark brown,
	 with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually darker than the rest of the coat.</p>
   <p>Lions live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. 
   Historically, they lived across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are mainly found in
   parts of Africa south of the Sahara.</p>
