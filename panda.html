                            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
    <p>The Panda, also known as the panda bear, is a bear species endemic to China. 
	It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant
	panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.</p>
     <p>Pandas eat almost exclusively bamboo shoots and leaves. Despite their vegetarian diet,
	 the animal’s digestive system resembles more like a carnivore’s. On the rare occasion that
	 they forgo bamboo, pandas will likely turn to other vegetation such as pumpkin, kidney beans,
	 wheat, as well as other foods like eggs, fish, and even small mammals.</p>
   <p>Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China,
   where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, 
   depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that
   function as opposable thumbs.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
